  # Hello, welcome to my profile!

I'm passionate about **Computer Networks** and **Cybersecurity**. I have experience in network administration, traffic analysis, implementing security solutions, and managing robust infrastructures. I believe information security is a key pillar for business continuity in the digital world.

On this profile, I share projects, studies, tutorials, and tools that can help you understand how computer networks work and how to ensure the protection and integrity of information in an increasingly complex digital environment.

## ‚ö° What I do?

- **Network Administration**: Planning and implementing local and wide-area networks (LAN/WAN), routing protocols, switches, and routers.
- **Network Security**: Protecting networks from external and internal threats, including firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS, encryption, and authentication.
- **Traffic Analysis and Monitoring**: Tools for packet capture and analysis such as Wireshark and tcpdump, network performance and traffic monitoring.
- **Penetration Testing (PenTest)**: Assessing the security of systems, networks, and web applications using ethical penetration techniques.
- **Incident Response**: Investigating and mitigating security incidents, conducting forensics analysis, and applying best practices for incident response.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Creating scripts to optimize network administration and security tasks using Python, Bash, PowerShell, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies I use

- **Protocols and Concepts**: TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SSL/TLS, VPNs, VLANs,SDWAN, BGP, RIP, OSPF
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows Server, Kali Linux, Cisco IOS
- **Security Tools**: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, Aircrack-ng, OpenVAS
- **Firewalls**: CheckPoint, Cisco ASA, SonicWALL, FortiGate
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl
- **Other Tools**: Docker, VS Code, Visual Studio, Trello, Slack, Git

## üå± Currently Learning

- **Advanced Cryptography**: Deepening my knowledge of cryptographic algorithms and protocols to enhance data security in networks.
- **Cloud Security**: Exploring best practices for securing cloud infrastructures (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Automation and DevSecOps**: Integrating security into the software development lifecycle with automation tools.


<!--## üìö Featured Projects

- **[Project 1 - Network Monitoring with Python](link)**: A simple system to monitor devices on a network with automated alerts.
- **[Project 2 - Wi-Fi Network Security Audit](link)**: A script for testing the security of Wi-Fi networks using dictionary attack techniques.
- **[Project 3 - Packet Analyzer with Wireshark](link)**: A case study on how to perform real-time packet analysis to detect network vulnerabilities.
